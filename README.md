# 🌿 Nutrient Drift AI

## 🧠 Overview

Nutrient Drift AI is a **hackathon prototype** that explores a new way of thinking about nutrition.

Most nutrition apps focus on **what to eat** (meal plans, calories, macros).  
This app focuses on **why nutrients silently go out of balance** due to modern lifestyles.

I built Nutrient Drift AI to detect **hidden nutrient imbalance caused by lifestyle stress** such as poor sleep, high screen time, and mental load — even before visible symptoms appear.

This project introduces a new concept called **Nutrient Drift**.

## ❓ What is Nutrient Drift?

**Nutrient Drift** happens when:
- Lifestyle-based nutrient demand (stress, sleep debt, screen exposure)
- Continues to increase
- While nutrient intake does not adapt accordingly

Over time, this mismatch can lead to fatigue, poor sleep quality, and reduced focus — even if the person feels they are “eating normally”.

This app does **not diagnose diseases**.  
It provides **early nutritional insights** based on lifestyle patterns.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Students and professionals often experience brain fog, low energy, and poor recovery  
- Blood tests are expensive and infrequent  
- Existing nutrition apps:
  - Focus on calories or meal plans
  - Ignore lifestyle-driven nutrient demand  

There is no simple tool that explains how modern lifestyles silently increase nutrient stress.

---

## 💡 Solution

Nutrient Drift AI:
- Analyzes daily lifestyle factors  
- Estimates relative nutrient demand  
- Compares demand vs intake  
- Highlights early nutrient drift patterns  
- Explains *why* the drift is happening  
- Suggests simple, food-first adjustments  

The goal is **awareness and prevention**, not treatment.

## 🧩 Key Features

- Lifestyle-based nutrient demand analysis  
- Nutrient Drift scoring (Low / Medium / High)  
- Explainable AI-style insights (clear reasoning, not black box)  
- Optional meal input for intake estimation  
- Nutrient Drift timeline (trend visualization)  
- Food-first, lifestyle-friendly suggestions  
- Clean, calm, modern UI with subtle animations  
- Fully frontend, demo-ready for hackathons  

---

## 🧪 Demo Flow

1. Start a 2-minute nutrient check  
2. Input:
   - Sleep duration  
   - Screen time  
   - Stress level  
   - Activity type  
3. Optionally upload a meal photo or select food  
4. App analyzes lifestyle-based nutrient demand  
5. Nutrient Drift results are shown with explanations  
6. Simple adjustment suggestions are provided  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **UI/UX:** Custom design with animations and glassmorphism  
- **Logic:** Rule-based nutrient reasoning (AI-inspired)  
- **Storage:** Browser local storage (demo-level persistence)  

> This project focuses on **concept validation and user experience**, not clinical accuracy.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app is for **educational and informational purposes only**.

- It does not provide medical advice  
- It does not diagnose any condition  
- Nutrient insights are approximate and lifestyle-based  
- Consult qualified professionals for medical or dietary decisions

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Modern lifestyles are changing faster than our diets adapt.

Nutrient Drift AI demonstrates how **AI-driven reasoning and explainability** can help people understand subtle health risks **before symptoms appear**.

---

## 📌 Hackathon Note

This is a **prototype built for a hackathon** to demonstrate:
- A novel concept (Nutrient Drift)  
- Clear problem–solution thinking  
- Responsible AI framing  
- Strong UX and demo clarity  

Future versions may include:
- Real AI models  
- Wearable integrations  
- Long-term tracking
